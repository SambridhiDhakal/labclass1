    <h3><em>Intoduction to Technology</em></h3>
    <p>
        From stone age to present, people are evolving. They collect their experiences like drops which now has helped to develop into a new era. 
        The scientific inventions have made life so much easier. But as it is said: <q>Every inventions has its pros and cons.</q> This era of science
        and technology also has both sides. From developing the world to destroying the world, science has invented everything. Technology is simply
        something that changes how life works; sometimes making it simple, sometimes making it complex.

    <h3><em>Advantages and Disadvantages</em></h3>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(138, 211, 187);">
        The pros of technology is how it has made the world into a global community. The discovery of mobile phones, transportation, communication,
        medical technologies has raised the lifestyle of people. The lives of people are much easier compared to past few decades. In contrast, they are
        relying in them for everything. According to <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO.</abbr> technology is making people monotonous,
         lack of creativity, Lack of socialness, causing obesity and heart problems etc. So, how technology is used in today's world simply depends 
         on human themselves. They should be used for protection and development rather than destruction.
